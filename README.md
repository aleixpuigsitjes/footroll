## How To Build Your Footroll Board Game

### The pitch
The pitch must be printed at scale 1 yard : 8 mm. The pitch must have a grid of black cells of 8 mm with a line width smaller than the regular lines which must be printed in white. The size of the pitch is not fixed but FIFA recommends a pitch size of 114x74 yards. However, this is a rather large pitch and it is recommended to play footroll in a smaller pitch (100 x 64 yards) to make the game play more fun. The pitch can be printed in color or in black and white (with inverted colors). Of course, the second option is cheaper. It is recommended to laminate it for better protection.

### The pawns
The pawns must be 8 mm in diameter to fit in one cell of the grid. The pawns should be ideally non-conical. You must have at least 2 teams of different colors with 18 pawns each. Use 2 numbered 8 mm color stickers on each pawn. Use a combination of colors that match your team’s colors.

### The Ball
The ball must be 8 mm in diameter.
